    - Firewall
    - Access Control List (ACL)
    - Obfuscation (e.g. Encryption)

- Possible Attack on Confidentiality
    - Network Eavesdropping
    - Credential Stuffing - use breached credentials against the system

[Back to Table of Content](#table-of-content)

## Integrity

    - Power Spike that cause the information corruption
    - Natural Disaster
 
- `Alteration`
- Possible controls/measures
    - Hashing and Integrity Moniroting
    - Enable MFA
    - Enable Controlled Folder Access (CFA)

- Possible Attack on Integrity

- Delay the users to get the resources
- Unintented/Non-malicious sources
    - Natural Disaster destroys datacenters

- `Denial`
- Possible controls/measures
    - Fault Tolerance

[Back to Table of Content](#table-of-content)

## DAD triad
- `Discolsure` attacks `Confidentiality`
- `Alteration` attacks `Integrity`
- `Denial` attacks `Availability`

[Back to Table of Content](#table-of-content)

# Security Principles
[Back to Table of Content](#table-of-content)

## Principle of Least Privilege
- An entity should be granted the lowest possible privileges as needed

[Back to Table of Content](#table-of-content)

## Zero Trust
- Take `Principle of Least Prvilege` and carries to `ultimate conclusion`
- Remove all implicit trust of networks
- Protecting resource with `granular authorization process` for every request

[Back to Table of Content](#table-of-content)

## Open Security
- System should not depend on its `secrecy`
- Even company `security measurement is exposed`, it `still be hard for attacker` to attack.
- Password should not be cracked even the algorithm is exposed

[Back to Table of Content](#table-of-content)

## Defense in Depth
- Adding many defense layer to the system as possible
- If one is bypassed, another may still prevent the attack

[Back to Table of Content](#table-of-content)

## Shift-Left Security
- Security is built in the architecture
- System has built-in security
- No need to add the additional layers of security
    - With input satinization, input validation, and prepare statement (Built-in security)
    - Web Application Firewall (Additional Layer of Security) to prevent SQL Injection is not required anymore

- Shift-Left can trade off somethings in business
    - More production and delivery time
    - More technical and technician are required
    - User frustation
    - Slower availability of the product
    - More complex product pipeline

[Back to Table of Content](#table-of-content)

## Administrative Segmentation
- Principle not to trust `a single entity (admin) to bypass all controls`
- Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS)
    - Have multiple admins
    - Each have admin have their `partial authorization or key.`
    - One admin `requires permission/authorization from other admins` before any action.

[Back to Table of Content](#table-of-content)

## Continuous Patching
- Always patch the outdated resource
- Patching may developed by company (company developed application)
- Patching may pull from trusted provider repository (third party application)
- Pipelining
    - Patch the development
    - Testing
    - Finally patch the production

- Cloud provider automatically patch their infrastructure
    - Reduce workload on patching pipeline

- Risk of [`supply chain attack`](Chapter2.md/#supply-chain-validation) (what if patching source code is malicious?)

[Back to Table of Content](#table-of-content)

# Breaching
[Back to Table of Content](#table-of-content)

## Security Breach
- Organization experiences breach of CIA triads
    - Hacker steal sensitive information
    - Earthquake destroys datacenter
    - Electricity run out

[Back to Table of Content](#table-of-content)

## Data Breach
- `Focus on information` rather than hardware, people, or software.
    - Sensitive information stolen by hacker
    - Exposed of company source code
    - Company information on black market/darkweb

- Data Breach is `part of Security Breach`

- data in database server
- data in flash drive
- Encryption at rest = data in the storage is encrypted

### Data in transit
- data that is in motion/transit over a `network`
- data that is on downloading, transmitting
- data that is an electric signal running in the cable line
- communication stream, data stream, streaming
- eavesdropping, sniffing, intercepting, spying = access to the data
- Encryption in transit = data is encrypted while transmitting
- Sometimes known as `End to End Encryption` - Ensure the data is communicated between intent sender and receiver.

### Data in use
- data that is processing by a computer system
- data in memory (RAM) or `data in process`
- access to the memory = access the data
- Normally, to process the data, the data `must be decrypted` first. (Risk to confidentiality if the RAM content is captured or stolen)

## Common Cyber Security Compliance

[Back to Table of Content](#table-of-content)

# Security Controls based on Desired Effect
- Officially classified by CompTIA
- Classified based on their desired effect

[Back to Table of Content](#table-of-content)

## Preventive Controls
- Stop security issue before it occur
- Firewall and Encryption
    - Stop hacker to reach the network
    - Stop hacker to understand the document

- Turn off/Remove the features that is risk
    - Email can be compromised, Stop using email (not a good idea)
    - Web can be hacked, Stop using web server (not a good idea)
    - Linux have announced zero-day exploit, Stop using Linux

## Deterrent Controls
- Make security occur harder
- Do not completely prevent like [preventive controls](#preventive-controls)
- Prevent attackter attempting to break the system
- Guard dogs - Intruder may tame the dog and able to break the system
- Web Application Firewall - Attacker may seek an advanced payload to evade the firewall
- Input Validation on client-side is `deterrent controls` to SQL Injection
    - Easily to be bypass

- Prepare Statement is `preventive controls` to SQL Injection
    - SQL Injection is completely useless

[Back to Table of Content](#table-of-content)

## Detective Controls
- Focus on identify the security event that has already occured
- Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
    - Alert when security incident is occured

[Back to Table of Content](#table-of-content)

## Corrective Controls

- Blacklist/Whitelist firewall rule after the attack
- Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR)
    - Automatically remidiate the security issue/incident

[Back to Table of Content](#table-of-content)

## Compensating Controls
- Mitigate the risk from exceptions/temporary exceptions
- Server is running Microsoft server 2012
    - It is legacy and have a lot of vulnerability
    - Cannot migrate to newer version due to the `legacy system` and excessive `migration cost`
    - Enhance `perimeter defense` such as network firewall, SIEM, isolating, ACL instead of patching or migrating to the better version.

- This software is outdated
    - The developer of software is already retired
    - No one can maintenance or fix it
    - Training new developer is too expensive
    - Primary use in production, cannot be replaced due to the `replacement cost`
    - Accept the risk, try to find all possible cheap and practical controls.

- Very concern in [PCI DSS](#payment-card-industry-data-security-standard-pci-dss) compliance

[Back to Table of Content](#table-of-content)

## Directive Controls

# Data Protection
[Back to Table of Content](#table-of-content)

## Data Obfuscation
- Alter the data to protect it

[Back to Table of Content](#table-of-content)

### Data Encryption
- use mathematical algorithms to protect data from `prying eyes`
- `Encryption at rest` and `Encryption at transit`
- `Encrypted data` can be called `Ciphertext`
- Utilize `key` to `decrypt` or reverse it back to the original state so that it can be utilized
- `Homomorphic Encryption` - Algorithm that enable data to be processed even it is encrypted

[Back to Table of Content](#table-of-content)

### Hashing
- Transform data into irreversible format (cannot track to the original data)
- Each data has it own unique hash value (if algorithm is strong)
- A small change in data = A large change in hash value (Avalance Affect)
- Can be used as `fingerprint` of the data
- With same algorithm, the length of the hash value is the same
    - MD5 hash size is 128 bits (weakest algorithm)
    - SHA-256 hash size is 256 bits (string and popular algorithm)
    - SHA3-512 hash size is 512 bits (strong algorithm)

- Still be reversible if `attacker` have a table of hash matching with a common original word - `dictionary attack`

[Back to Table of Content](#table-of-content)

### Tokenization
- Replace value (or sensitive value) with a unique identifier using a lookup table
    - Replace name with random number - look to the table to convert number back to the name

- Need to `secure lookup table`

[Back to Table of Content](#table-of-content)

### Data Masking
- Replace value (or sensitive value) with a specific characters
- Cannot convert back to the original data like `tokenization`
- For example replace the last 4 digits of ID with "XXXX" or "****"
    - 091-112-3345 => 091-XXX-XXXX
    - 1203455562001 => 1203*********
    - John Smith => John S****
- Commonly found in credit card information, identification number

[Back to Table of Content](#table-of-content)

## Data Minimization
- Reduce the amount of sensitive data as possible
- Sometimes it is impossible to completely remove the sensitive data

[Back to Table of Content](#table-of-content)

### Data Discovery
- Discover where the data is located
    - Database, on-premises server
    - Cloud Storage
    - Cloud Native Application such as Google Docs
    - Collaboration systems such as Microsoft SharePoint
    - Physical document
    - Digital document such as spreadsheets, PDFs, or email

[Back to Table of Content](#table-of-content)

### Data Classification
- Classify by their sensitive
    - Confidential/Restricted
    - Internal Use Only
    - Public/Unrestricted

- Content-based Classification - reviewing the content
- Context-based Classification - reviewing only the metadata
- User-based Classification - review the user
- Each classified data can be [`tag`](#data-loss-prevention-dlp) especially the sensitive data.

[Back to Table of Content](#table-of-content)

### Data Deidentification
- Sometimes known as `Data Anonymization`
- Remove the ability of data to link back to the individual.
- [Hashing](#hashing), [Tokenization](#tokenization), [Masking](#data-masking) can be used to deidentify the data.
- Replace with random value or other value - `Data Substitution`
    - John Smith => ABC BCC
    - 091-854-4455 => 012-345-6789

[Back to Table of Content](#table-of-content)

### Data Erasure
- Destroy data when it is no longer necessary
- Destroy data due to the compliance/regulations
- Data cannot breach if `it does not exist`
- `Data Shredding`
    - completely wiping out the data from storage device
    - use special techniques to reset the magnetics or electrons

- Physical Data Destruction - A paper shredder
- Data Overwriting

[Back to Table of Content](#table-of-content)

## Data Resiliency
- Recovery from data loss
- Data Redundancy - Backup Data or store multiple copied of data
- Fault Tolerance - System can cope the error without loss of data
- Disaster Recovery Planning - Plan before the data is loss
- Data Integrity Monitoring - Monitor if data is altered
- Scalability - Able to operate in any size of data volume

## Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
- Systems that help organization to prevent data loss, thef, breach, or leakage
- They can block sensitive data transmission before the damange is done
- They can alert the admin of sensitive data is risk or already breached
- Utilize `pattern matching` or `Pattern Recognition`
    - Detect the number pattern that clearly credit card number - block the traffic.
    - Detect terms `API_key`, `DB_Password` - block the traffic.
    - Detect terms `top secret` or `business confidential`
    - Regular expression, matching string, string contain, and more

- Utilize `Watermarking`
    - Admin apply electronic tags to the sensitive document.
    - if DLP detect `tag`, it can block the traffic.
    - Work even the data is encrypted. - it look to the tag not the content.
    - commonly used in `Digital Rights Management (DRM)` - easy to detect if copyright data is breached by `inspecting the embedded tag`

### Agent-based DLP
- Software that installed on system to protect sensitive information
- Sometimes called `host-based DLP`
- Can monitor system configuration, user activity, blocking undesirable actions
    - For example, block USB device
    - Deny the attempt to send the sensitive data
    - Search for sensitive data in the system

- Fine-grained control that it the agent can be deployed in any devices, easily to track the event source as well as protect them
- Performance issue that DLP software also consume CPU and memory

### Agentless DLP
- No additional software is required to be install in any device.
- Work on network region instead of a host/device. Sometimes called `network-based DLP`
- Monitor network traffic - watching unencrypted sensitive information to be transmitted
- Block the traffic that risk to data loss, violate the policy

## Data Governance
- Define policy and procedure to protect the data
- Define Data Lifecycle Management
    - Creation
    - Use
    - Destroy
- Data [Access Restriction](#access-restrictions) and Security controls

[Back to Table of Content](#table-of-content)

### Data Governance Team
- Data Admin
    - Oversee the data governance program

- Data Steward
    - Bridge between business and IT
    - define rule
    - optimize workflow

- Data Custodian 
    - Implement IT solution from business requirement regarding to data
    - Technical Engineer

### Data Sovereignty
- Restriction of data movement and storage
    - A specific Thai government data should not be distributed to other countries.
    - Data should be stored and transit in site Thailand only
    - European data should not be breach from the europe broder

- Commonly found in privacy regulation such as GDPR or PDPA
- Affect many cloud provider - govern data stored in cloud
    - Even `Amazon Web Service (AWS)` has servers in all regions of the world, AWS must agree with the US government that some specific data `should not store in servers those are not in USA`

## Access Restrictions
- Limit ability to access the sensitive data

[Back to Table of Content](#table-of-content)

### Geographical Restriction
- Limited access based on `physical location`
- Chinese user cannot access a specific Thai database server

[Back to Table of Content](#table-of-content)

### Permission Restriction
- Limited access based on `role or level of authorization`
- Internship cannot access infrastructure database

[Back to Table of Content](#table-of-content)

### Segmentation and Isolation
- Limited access based on `network location`
- Accountant network cannot access Developer database on developer network
- Isolating the development network from public network
