## Prevent write to known-hosts file
- Prevent new-comming SSH connection to corrupt known-hosts file. Without this, you may see
    - Warning: Permanently added '&lt;host&gt;' (&lt;key type&gt;) to the list of known hosts.

- use `-o "UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null"`
- It actually read the known host list from `/dev/null` which is nothing to the linux.
- Actual known host list is on `~/.ssh/known_hosts`

Example
```bash
ssh -o "UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null" admin@192.168.1.1
```

## Skip Host Key Checking
- Skip checking for new-comming SSH connection public key. Without this, you may see
    - &lt;key type&gt; key fingerprint is &lt;Hash Value&gt;
    - This key is not known by any other names.

- use `-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no`

Example
```bash
ssh -o "StrictHostKeyChecking=no` -o `UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null` admin@192.168.1.1
```
